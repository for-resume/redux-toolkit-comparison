## How did I create this project?

1. I created a Typescript template create-react-app project by running <br />
   `npx create-react-app rtk --template typescript`
2. I installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` to be able to generate unique IDs.
3. I removed most of the starter code that CRA gives you and created the template that you see above.
